# timestamp
Free Code Camp Timestamp Project

This program accepts a string as a parameter and returns a unix timestamp as well as the natural date (i.e. January 11, 2015).
The htacess file converts the parameter at the end of the url to the timestamp parameter.

The live version can be found at https://www.ezchx.com/timestamp/(input parameter here).
